# Hololens2ArUcoDetection
Hololens 2 detection of ArUco markers using openCV in research mode. Body of code forked and additions to track multiple markers at once.

Developed into an angle tracker between the 3 fiducial markers (ArUco codes). The angle and angular velocity data is then sent back to a PC in UDP packets before live plotting the data in Python.
